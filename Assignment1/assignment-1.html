    <h2>Information Of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to
        think like humans and mimic their actions.</b> The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibit straits
        associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.The ideal characteristic of artificial
        intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific
        goal.<br> A subset of artificial intelligence is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/machine-learning.asp " target="_blank">machine learning</a> which
        refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being
        assisted by humans. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deep-learning.asp" target="blank">Deep
        learning</a> techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured
        data such as text, images, or video.</p><br>

    <h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <b>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless.<em>The technology can be applied to many different sectors
    and industries.</em></b> AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and
    different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.<br>

    <b><sub>Other examples</sub></b> of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and
    self-driving cars.Each of these machines must weigh the <strong>consequences</strong> of any action they take, as each action will
    impact the end result. <b><sup>In chess</sup></b>, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system
    must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.<br>

    Artificial <del>intelligent</del><ins>Intelligence</ins> also has applications in the financial industry,<mark> where it
    is used to detect and flag activity in banking</mark> and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account depositsâ€”all of which help a
    bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is
    done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.<br>
