    <h2>Information Of Maharashtra</h2>
    <p>Maharashtra is a state in the western and central peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion
        ofthe Deccan Plateau. The centre of India is in this state. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in
        India
        as well as the third-most populous country subdivision in the world. It was formed on 1 May 1960 by splitting
        the bilingual
        Bombay State, which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking
        Gujarat. Thus Maharashtra is a Marathi linguistic state. <i>The state is divided into 6 divisions and 36
            districts,
            with the state capital being Mumbai, also the most populous urban area in India and Nagpur serving as the
            winter
            capital. The Godavari and the Krishna are the two major rivers in the state. Marathi is the most widely
            spoken
            language and is also the official language of the state. </i>The forest cover in the state is 16.47% of the
        state's
        geographical area. Out of total cultivable land in Maharashtra about 60% land is under food grain crops with
        Jowar (Sorghum bicolor) being the dominating crop.Maharashtra is the most industrialised state in India and the
        state's capital, Mumbai is India's financial and commercial hub. <del>The state has played a significant role in
            the country's</del> social and political life and widely considered a leader in terms of agricultural and
        industrial
        production, trade and transport, and education. Maharashtra is among the most developed Indian states and
        continues to be the single largest contributor to the national economy with a share of 15% in the country's
        GDP. The economy of Maharashtra is the largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of
        ₹32.24 trillion (US$450 billion) and GSDP per capita of ₹251,000 (US$3,500).[3] Maharashtra is the
        fifteenth-highest ranking among Indian states in human development index.</p>

        <dt style="font-size:30px;"><b>Mumbai</dt></b>
        <dd>Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) is a densely populated city on India’s west coast. A financial center, it's
            India's largest city. On the Mumbai Harbour waterfront stands the iconic Gateway of India stone arch, built
            by the British Raj in 1924. Offshore, nearby Elephanta Island holds ancient cave temples dedicated to the
            Hindu god Shiva. The city's also famous as the heart of the Bollywood film industry.The seven islands that
            came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries,
            the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese
            Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of
            Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During
            the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the
            area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the
            reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay
            in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century
            it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India’s independence in 1947 the city was
            incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of
            Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.</dd>
