    <h2>Why do we call nashik</h2><br>

        <img src="img/history.jpg"></div><br>
        <p>Nashik was known as Panchavati before Ramayana period. Nashik has mythological, historical, social and cultural
        importance. The city is situated on the banks of the Godavari River, making it one of the holiest places for
        Hindus all over the world. Nashik has a rich historical past, as the mythology has it that Lord Rama, the King
        of Ayodhya, made Nashik his abode during his 14 years in exile. At the same place Lord Laxman, by the wish of
        Lord Rama, cut the nose of “Shurpnakha” and thus this city was named as “Nashik”. After the fall of the
        Satavahana empire, the Abhiras or Ahirs ruled in the north east and the Chutus in Maharashtra and Kuntala. The
        Puranas state that ten Abhiras ruled for, 67 years. The Nasik inscription speaks of king Madhuriputra
        Ishvarasena, the Abhir and a son of Shivadatla. This dynasty originated in A. D. 249-50, an era called Kalachuri
        or Chedi in later times.In Kritayuga, Nashik was ‘Trikantak’, ‘Janasthana’ in Dwaparyuga and later in Kuliyuga it became ‘Navashikh’ or
        ‘Nashik’. Classical Sanskrit poets like Valmiki, Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti have paid rich tributes here. In 150 BC
        Nashik was the country’s largest market place. From 1487 A.D, the province came under the rule of Mughals and
        was known as Gulshanabad. It was also home of Emperor Akbar who wrote at length about Nashik in Ein-e-Akbari. It
        was also known as the ‘Land of the Brave’ during the regime of Shivaji. The most important historical
        significance is that Kumbh Mela is conducted at Nashik once every twelve years, out of 4 places in India</p>
